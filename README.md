# auto-login-script

## Description
This is a script I wrote in my spare time which automates the process of logging into MyEd and then Learn so you don't have to manually go through the process of clicking three buttons each time.

## How to use
If you're running it for the first time follow the steps below:
1) Navigate to the path in which you've saved the file in cmd prompt or terminal
2) Run the command 'python edLogin -n'
3) You will be prompted to put in your login details
4) The program should automatically log you into MyEd

If you've done the steps above once already then:
1) Navigate to the same path
2) Run the command 'python edLogin'
3) The program should automatically log you in

## Compatability
Currently, this script only works on Windows. It also requires that you have a version of Chrome installed which matches with chromedriver.exe.
In my testing, Chrome version 118.0.5993.118 works fine.
